# ToDo-List-App

This is a simple To do list that allows signed up users to create flexible schedule list of their to do's. 

This App works using the simple CRUD functionalities. Therefore users can create a list, Read it, update it and delete a schedule.
Upon operating the app, users need to sign up first then log in with thier username and password. 
A token authentication is only needed when a user wants to delete a list.

UI implementation and modification would be built for user experience.  

I know its just a small project but if you have a suggestion, contribution or critiscism. Its 100% welcomed. cheers !
