Steps: 
Use MVC pattern
create folders: Controllers, middlewares, models, routes, test.
then files: db, app, package.json, server, gitignore, env.

server is where the server is created. App controls and distributes basic & diversed functionalities. 
One of the reasons we create server and app separately is to make testing possible (according to experience)

Use jwt for authenticating sign in and sign up.
Use passport-jwt for authenticating certain routes

connect db
install packages
create server
create models
create authentication & its Controllers
create routes
run tests (in package.json, in script, set test to jest, install jest and supertest, run "npm run test")
...
BOOM
